## Hi there 👋

Im Kazuki, a mechanical engineering grad student in Brazil.

I code with python and i like numerical simulations and cfd.

I like to solve PDE's using FEA, and try to simulate then using FEniCSx.

If i could escape the hot climate of Brazil, i would probably go to Hokkaido and lay on the snow all day
